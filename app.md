1. Initial Setup
You should already have a new React project set up using Create React App. If not, follow the earlier instructions to set up a new project named renthub.

## 2. Install Necessary Dependencies
For this project, you might want to use React Router for navigation:

bash
Copy code
## npm install react-router-dom
Save to grepper
## 3. Folder Structure
In the src folder, you can organize your app as:

components: Where reusable components will reside.
views: Major views or pages of the application.
assets: Images, icons, etc.
utils: Helper functions, constants.
services: API calls, blockchain functions.
## 4 . Create Components
4.1. User Registration & Login:

src/views/Auth.js
Create a form to collect user details for registration.
Include a section for login for already registered users.
After successful registration or login, redirect the user to the property listing or property creation page based on their role.
## 4.2. Property Listing & Creation:

src/views/PropertyListing.js
Display properties available for rent/sale.
Allow filtering and searching.
src/views/AddProperty.js
Form to let property owners list their properties.
Collect property details, images, and specify available dates for showroom.
4.3. Property Details & Booking:

src/views/PropertyDetail.js
Display all details of a property.
Allow potential renters/buyers to book a showroom session.
4.4. Review & Rating:

src/views/Reviews.js
Let buyers/renters leave reviews on the platform.
Allow specification of property or owner and provide a rating (1-5).
5. Setting Up Routes
In your src/App.js, use BrowserRouter from react-router-dom to set up routes:

jsx
Copy code
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
// ... import your views ...

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/register" component={Auth} />
        <Route path="/properties" component={PropertyListing} />
        <Route path="/add-property" component={AddProperty} />
        <Route path="/property/:id" component={PropertyDetail} />
        <Route path="/reviews" component={Reviews} />
        <Route path="/" exact component={HomePage} />
        {/* Add a 404 Not Found route etc. */}
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
Save to grepper
6. Styling
You might want to use a component library like Material-UI, Ant Design, or Bootstrap to speed up the development process with pre-made components. Depending on your choice, install the necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
npm install @material-ui/core
// or
npm install antd
// or
npm install bootstrap
Save to grepper
7. Connect to Backend/Blockchain
As you develop the frontend, you'll need to integrate with the blockchain or any other backend. Use the web3.js library to connect with Ethereum for the blockchain functionality.

8. Testing
Make sure to test your application regularly. You can use Jest (which comes bundled with CRA) or any other testing library of your choice.

This is a basic structure to get you started. Depending on your requirements and functionalities, you might need to add or modify certain parts. Remember to commit your changes frequently and keep backups.
